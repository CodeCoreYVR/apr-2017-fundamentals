'this is a string'

"this is also a string"

// double quotes and single quotes are the same for Javascript when it comes
// to defining strings

// to espace a character in Javascript you can put a backslash before it:
'I\'ll go there'

// backticks have been introduced in ES6
`this yet another way to define a string`

// String interpolation is injecting a piece of Javascript code within strings
`1 + 1 is ${1 + 1}`

// \n is a new-line character
"Hello \n World"

"one" + "two"

4 + '5' // this will give us '45'

4 + parseInt('5') // this will give us '9'

"hello".length // this will give us 5

"Hello"[3] // this will give us `l`

("Hello, " + "Rosa" + "!").length

" tam  ".trim() // will return "tam"

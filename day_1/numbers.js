// the module operator `%` will yield the remainder of dividing the first number
// by the second number

10 % 4 // this will give us 2
10 % 5 // this will give us 0

// so we know that a number is perfectly divisible by another number if the
// result of the `%` is 0

// Write a piece of code that generates a random number between 0 and 99
Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)
